# C# Class Generator for Petapoco 

**What's this?**

It's a simple utility to generate C# Classes for direct POCO usage with Petapoco from a database using a connection string.

**Wait, what's Petapoco again?**

[Petapoco](https://github.com/CollaboratingPlatypus/PetaPoco)'s a totally awesome little ORM that's lightweight and easy to use! If you're like me, and want uh, simple libraries to work with, take a look at it!

**But why? Doesn't Petapoco come with a T4 template already?**

Petapoco comes with a T4 Template that allows you to generate classes directly from the solution. However, leveraging on the simplicity and elegance of Petapoco, sometimes I want a really dumbed down POCO class to work with.
