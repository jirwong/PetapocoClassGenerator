# C# Class Generator for Petapoco 

** What is this? **

It's a simple utility to generate C# Classes for direct POCO usage from a database using a connection string.

** But why? **

Petapoco comes with a T4 Template that allows you to generate classes directly from the solution. However, leveraging on the simplicity and elegance of Petapoco, sometimes I want a really dumbed down POCO class to work with.
